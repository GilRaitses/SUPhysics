6. **CU*iP**** Purpose and Aims: **The goal of [APS CU*](https://www.aps.org/programs/women/cuwip/)[iP](https://www.aps.org/programs/women/cuwip/) is to help undergraduate women and gender minorities continue in physics by providing them with the opportunity to experience a professional conference, information about graduate school and professions in physics, and access to peers in physics of all ages with whom they can share experiences, advice, and ideas. The national and local organizing committees of APS CU*iP strive to create a welcoming environment for all.

4. List/link of other sites (map is not required, but nice visual to have)

5. Add some language so applicants get a snapshot of what CU*iP is about. 

7. What types of activities will take place? (i.e. keynote, plenaries, workshops, poster session, career fair, networking session etc.)

8. All meals and accommodation during the conference are organized and the costs are met by CU*iP. Travel to the conference is usually paid for by attendees' home departments, and if this is not possible there are funds available to support travel to CU*iP (see details here) so no one has to miss out on CUWiP for financial reasons.

9. A statement about your institution?s commitment to diversity and inclusion so applicants feel welcome

6. Have a prominent application button with date on the front page (suggestion: include "sign up for reminder" link before application website opens).  Include the application deadline and link to application. [https://www.aps.org/programs/women/CU*iP/CU*iPapp.cfm](https://www.aps.org/programs/women/cuwip/cuwipapp.cfm) 

7. Add Participation allocation text.

10. CU*iP has become incredibly popular. In order to maximize the number of CU*iP participants we can accommodate, we will allocate participants to sites based on travel logistics and site capacity. Please do not purchase travel tickets or plan to be at a specific site until you receive an email confirming you have been accepted to a specific CU*iP site.
